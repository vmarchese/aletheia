# Aletheia (ἀλήθεια)

Aletheia (ἀλήθεια) is the ancient Greek word for truth. Etymologically it’s a- (“not”) + lēthē (“forgetting/hiddenness”), so literally “un-hiddenness,” “un-concealment.”
The Greeks sometimes personified Aletheia as a minor goddess of Truth (the Roman counterpart is Veritas). She isn’t a major myth character, but appears in literature and rhetoric as the ideal of candor and factuality.

In philosophy.
- Parmenides used aletheia for the path of what is (reality) versus doxa (mere opinion).
- Plato/Aristotle treat it as correspondence—saying of what is that it is.
- Heidegger re-emphasized the original sense: truth as “un-concealment”—bringing what’s hidden into the open.

Modern sense: beyond “truth,” it connotes revealing, making explicit what’s obscured.
