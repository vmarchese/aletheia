- Read #AGENTS.md
- Use a memory file to store information between interactions. The memory file should be named `.claude/memory.txt`. 
- Each interaction should append to the memory file, not overwrite it.
- At the start of each interaction, read the memory file and use its contents to inform your response.
- At the end of each interaction, summarize the key points and append them to the memory file.
- separate the different sections of the memory file with a line of dashes (`--------------------`)  and a timestamp for clarity.
